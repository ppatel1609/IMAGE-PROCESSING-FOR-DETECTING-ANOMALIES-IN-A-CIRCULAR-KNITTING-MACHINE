The project aims on catching anomalies in a cloth knit by a circular knitting machine due to any kind of thread or kneedle breakage or any other faults.
This is doen by capturing iamges continously and then using image processing(using python libraries like OpenCV and Pillow) to further highlight those anomalies and catch the said defect.
There has been a use of multiple different methods like Pixel Transformations,Geometric Operations,Spatial Operations in Image Processing etc.
Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing course offered by IBM on coursera was used as a reference point for learning the same.
